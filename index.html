    <h1>Privacy Policy for Storage Bubbles: Phone Cleaner</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Storage Bubbles: Phone Cleaner</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data and the permissions required to provide our file cleaning and management services.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>1. File Access and Management Permissions</h3>
        <p>To function as a file cleaner and manager, Storage Bubbles requires the <strong>"All Files Access" (MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)</strong> permission on Android 11+ devices (or Read/Write Storage permissions on older versions).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why is this needed?</strong><br>
        This permission allows the app to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scan your device storage to identify large files, cache, and unused items.</li>
            <li>Visualize files (photos, videos, archives, docs) as interactive bubbles based on their size.</li>
            <li>Allow you (the user) to delete selected files to free up device space.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Our Privacy Commitment:</strong><br>
        We strictly respect your privacy. <strong>We do NOT browse, collect, upload, or share your personal files (photos, videos, documents) with any external servers.</strong> All file scanning, visualization, and deletion processes are performed <strong>locally</strong> on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Data Collection (Advertisements)</h3>
    <p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements within the app. AdMob acts as a data controller and may collect and process certain information to provide personalized ads and analytics. This data may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advertising ID (AAID)</li>
        <li>Device information (model, operating system)</li>
        <li>Approximate location (based on IP address)</li>
        <li>App performance data (crash logs, diagnostics)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data collection is governed by <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>3. Device Permissions Explained</h3>
    <p>Beyond file access, the app may request the following permissions for specific functionalities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>INTERNET / ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE:</strong> Required by Google AdMob to load advertisements.</li>
        <li><strong>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> Required on older Android versions to scan and delete files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Security</h3>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your information. Since file processing is local, your personal files remain secure on your hardware. Data transmission related to advertisements is encrypted using standard protocols (HTTPS).</p>

    <h3>5. Children’s Privacy</h3>
    <p>Our services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h3>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
